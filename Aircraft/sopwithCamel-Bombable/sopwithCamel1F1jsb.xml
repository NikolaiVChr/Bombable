JSBSim aerodynamic model for a Sopwith Camel 1F1 

Version: 1.6

Author: Brent Hugh, 6 May 2013

Goal: Create a flight model of the Camel that would incorporate as many of the documented combat flight characteristics of the Camel as possible, and in as realistic a way as possible.

<!-- Max sustained turn rate is about 76 deg/sec.  That is near stall speed, level flight, at sea level.  http://home.comcast.net/~clipper-108/AIAAPaper2005-119.pdf p. 7 -->

<!-- "I lived its quick response - it was so remarkably swift and sensitive that it demanded constant attention.  The torque caused the nose to rise in a left-hand turn and drop in a right-hand turn.  Fairly large amounts of left rudder were needed in bothturns to correct for these idiosyncrasis. The tiny biplane was so snesitive in a turn, however, that if the turn were tightened just a little, it was likely to whip into a tight spin - quickly and without warning.  Oddly this very ease for spining was used in combat by many pilots to shake a persistent German from their tails. sopwith Came vs Fokker Dr 1: Western Front 1917-18 by Jon Guttman, Harry Dempsey, quoting from mark Curtis Kinney's memoir, I Flew a Camel 

Here is a description about the Camel's traits from BARKER VC, (via author Wayne Ralph at http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/2001/11306-sopwith-camel-flight-characteristics.html ):

Quote:

All the weight of the engine, guns, and pilot was concentrated in the first seven feet of a short 18-foot fuselage. The various models of rotary engine fitted to the Camel, from a 110-hp Le Rhone, to a 130-hp Clerget, to a 150-hp Bentley, had the propeller attached to the engine crankcase and the crankshaft to the aircraft so that the propeller and engine revolved together at more than 1250 rpm. This heavy whirling engine was lubricated continually by castor oil which was not recycled, but rather was burned in the combustion process and vented overboard, soaking the aircraft, the pilot's flying suit, helmet and goggles.
The gyroscopic forces that were generated varied in intensity based on a complex interaction of engine rpm, aircraft speed, and control input. The scout had a different character turning left or right, as did all the rotary-engined aeroplanes, but the Camel to an extreme degree. It was sluggish in left turns and the nose always pitched up, while right turns were very quick, with the nose dropping sharply. Without plenty of top (ie, left) rudder to correct the pitch down, it would spin.
A Camel pilot had to apply left rudder turning left or right, the amount varying with aircraft speed and engine rpm. Since the engine rotation countered the input of left stick and rudder, some pilots made all turns to the right because the aircraft was quicker through 270 degrees, than 90 degrees to the left. The Camel's elevator was powerful and sensitive, while the rudder was too small and relatively ineffective.
Coordinated turns demanded a fine touch. Correcting sideslip, the tendency of the aeroplane to slide to the inside of a banked turn, by applying opposite rudder, caused the Camel to tighten up in the turn. In steep turns over 45 degrees of bank, the aircraft tended to pitch up its nose, and tighten up its bank angle as speed reduced, requiring continual adjustments in the amount of forward pressure on the stick with engine rpm changes. In the words of test pilot W/C Paul A. Hartman, RCAF, the Camel has no 'dynamic longitudinal stability' in steep turns.
Accelerating the aircraft caused the nose to climb, and swing to the left. At 110 miles per hour, there was about 15 to 20 pounds of back force on the control column, which could not be trimmed out because the aircraft had no pilot-adjustable, moveable horizontal stabilizer. Therefore, Camel pilots had to fly two-to-three hour missions, continually applying forward pressure just to maintain level flight. Letting go resulted in the aircraft pitching up, and rolling inverted to the right. Moving the stick forward to enter a dive caused the Camel to yaw left because of gyroscopic force, and correcting this yaw with right rudder caused the nose to pitch down sharply. By today's standards the Camel was completely unacceptable, and yet many pilots of 1917-8, most with under 100 hours of flying time used it as a lethal weapon.

 In those notes are a description of when and why the mixture had to be adjusted. If memory serves, it was perilously low to the ground, under 250 feet. The shift to left rudder would have to have taken place either just before or just after this, because the whole point of changing the mixture was that the engine would have been on the verge of choking, which means that you'd be trying to maintain flying speed.

My guess is that the shift would have to happen within 10-20 seconds of getting airborne under normal circumstances.

- - - 

"...all flights of these early machines were conducted from the grass surface of the airfield, not the paved runways, and the steerable tail skid of the Camel helped to overcome a slight swing to the left as I opened the throttle. The tail came up at about 20 knots.

As the speed reached 40 knots I eased the stick back slightly and the Camel became airborne. It accelerated rapidly to 55 knots and I held it in a climb at that speed until I reached 500 feet. I leveled off, leaned the mixture, and started a left hand turn. The gyroscopic effect from the rotary engine quickly became apparent...

...I enjoyed flying the Camel, but its vices of control instability, extreme control sensitivity and pronounced gyroscopic effects all combined to create the impression of balancing an egg on the point of a needle rather than flying an aircraft...it was never forced into manoeuvres - they were executed by light pressure on the controls and subsequently relaxing, or sometimes reversing, the pressure once the desired rate of response was attained.

By modern standards of stability and control, the Camel would be totally unacceptable as a military aircraft...

(quoted from Canada's National Aviation Museum - Its History and Collection, by K.M. Molson)

"As I opened the throttle I simultaneously applied full left rudder and as I became airborn I found that I had full left rudder on. (This was the answer always, as I afterwards found, and I was never in trouble again from this cause)"

August 98 issue of FLight journal has the flying of the Camel by Rich King. 160 Hp Gnome engine (yes, rotary)
qoute:
..Right rudder is needed to keep the Camel tracking straight ahead while it is on the runway, and as the tail comes up, I find that my rudder correction was right on. I m facing straight down the center of the runway.........A little back pressure on the control stick and the bumpy ground falls away behind me, and the Camels speed continues to increase at an exhilarating rate. A little forward pressure on the "closh handle" hold the aeroplane a few feet above the runway while its speed continues to increase. ....
Left Rudder is now needed to keep the racing Camel straight....." end quote

From the Frank Tallman book "Flying the old planes"...

My Sopwith Camel is, as far as I'm aware, the only original World War 1 Camel ever brought back to flying condition. It was originally owned by Colonel Jarrett of the Jarrett War Museum located on the old Steel Pier in Atlantic City; who in the 1930's had the best museum of WWI equipment ever assembled, including the Belgian War Museum in Brussels. The Jarrett Museum fell on hard times following WWII and, with time and money on my side after my service period, and a lifelong ambition of owning a WWI aircraft, I purchased for a small sum (by today's standards) several antique aircraft including the Camel, a Nieuport 28, a Pfalz D.XII, a Fokker D.VII and a SPAD VII.

The Camel was the first WWI aircraft I brought back to flying condition and required some major rebuilding, which took several years, many thousands of dollars and a whole host of experts including Paul Poberzney of the Experimental Aircraft Association, the gifted master craftsman Ned Kensinger, the Hawker Siddeley Group and a number of very dedicated volunteer's.

(NB: There is quite a bit on the rebuilding process in the Chapter but I have left it out of this extract for the sake of space).

When the day finally came to fly the air was filled with great anticipation. On arrival at the airport though I was dismayed to hear from my team that they had been trying to get the temperamental 110 h.p. Le Rhone started since 8.00am that morning, without success. The lack of knowledge amongst us regarding the Le Rhone was appalling. Did we have spark? Yes. Was the mag set? Yes. Had the commutator ring been wiped off? Yes. Had we primed it? Only every other cylinder.

With only a vague notion of what I was doing I clambered into the cockpit (a very tight fit) and reviewed the cord-wrapped Spade stick, the Block tube, carburettors next to one's knees, the flexible air intake to the outside air scoops, the wood wire brace longerons, the instrument panel with it's clutter and the duel control cables to the wooden rudder bar. At my request, the crew forced open the intake valves as the engine was pushed through (switch off) and shot a charge of fuel in each cylinder, as the cylinder came in front of the hole in the cowling. By accident, rather than by knowledge, I advanced the long lever controlling the air, and in pushing the manet (a small wheel knob on the miniature control quadrant) forward and then returning it, I had hit on the correct starting procedure. Wonder of wonders, as I flipped the porcelain-mounted switch up and called for contact, the Le Rhone started with a full-throated bellow, scaring both me and the crew!

By shoving the fuel-controlling lever forward and using the coupe (cut-out) button on the stick, I was able to keep the engine running. Soon the never-to-be-forgotten smell of castor oil infused our area, and the sight of oil splattering the leading edge of the low wings indicated that the engine was lubricating properly. Taxiing practice ended ignominiously a hundred feet from the starting point, when my newfound knowledge wasn't equal to the delicate adjustment of fuel and air, and the Le Rhone quit.

The revitalised ground crew hauled the 900 pound airplane over the grass and faced me into the wind. For safety sake we changed the plugs, and the Le Rhone started first try. I headed down the field with the throttle wide open. The tail came up almost instantly, and visibility was good, except for the Aldis sight and the twin Vickers. Not having planned on flight it came as something of a shock to find the Camel airborne at about 35 mph after a ground run of just 150 feet. Being afraid of jockeying with my ticklish fuel and air controls I stayed low and just got used to the Camel's sensitive ailerons, elevators and rudder.

I circled the field once, got into position for landing, shut fuel air and switch off, and made a light forward slip, touching down gently on three points. Total landing couldn't have been much longer than the initial take-off run.

So much for my first (unintentional) flight in the Camel.

Since then I've spent more time flying the Camel than any of the other historical aircraft in our collection. I've also had more forced landings in it than all the rest of the WWI aircraft combined. It's that temperamental Le Rhone. Cylinders have blown, magneto's have failed, even fouled spark plugs have brought me down unceremoniously, with sweating hands and my heart in my mouth, desperately seeking a patch of open ground on which to land. Yet for all that it's the one I turn to first for any show or exhibition, as the Camel gets my blood going like no other. This is an aircraft that is a joy to fly.

With the Le Rhone 9J, you cannot adjust either the fuel or air intake without running the risk of a dead-stick landing. You must leave them alone and use you Coupe (cut-out) button for all fight handling.

The take-off run is easy. In a wind of 10 to 15 knots you are airborne in a couple of plane lengths at 35 mph and climbing out at 60 mph, with a rate of climb of almost 1,000 feet a minute. The elevators are sensitive, as is the rudder. Consequently, when fling for any distance I often put the heels of my shoes on the floor tie wires, because the vibration of the Le Rhone through the rudder bar exaggerates the rudder movements.

In level flight at 100 mph indicated, the Camel is delightful, with just a hint of rudder being required for straight flight. The structure is rugged enough to feel comfortable in loops, and being slightly tail-heavy it goes up and over in an incredibly small circle in the sky, and faster than any other WWI aircraft I have flown. Sneeze and your halfway through a loop before your aware of what's happened. 110 mph is enough to carry you through, and as you slow down over the top you must feed in rudder against the torque.

In military shows I have ground strafed, and as soon as the airspeed reaches 130 to 140 mph the nose begins to hunt up and down, and the elevator becomes extremely sensitive. I feel this action is due largely to the square windshield between the two Vickers guns, causing a substantial burble over the tail surfaces.

Turns are what the Camel is all about. Turning to the right with the torque requires the top rudder to hold the nose up, and the speed with which you can complete a 360-degree turn is breathtaking. Left turns are slower, with the nose wanting to rise during the turn. But small rudder input easily keeps the nose level with the horizon. In stalls at 35 to 40 mph the nose drops frighteningly fast and hard to the right, but you also get control back quickly, although a surprising amount of altitude has been lost. I have had the pleasure of limited dog fighting with other WWI fighters, and there are none that can stay with a Camel in a turn.

With the Le Rhone being temperamental as it is, flying the Camel is best done at times when there are few other aircraft in the sky, leaving easy access to the airport in cases of emergency. The Camel touches down easily but runs out of rudder control almost instantly, and if you bounce your landing at all, you are likely to find yourself in a hairy ground loop looking at a rapidly bending aileron dragging in the grass.

For a wide variety of reasons, the Camel is a fascinating airplane, flight-wise as well as historically. But don't think I ever got out of the Camel after being airborne even in the coldest weather without buckets of perspiration and considerable gratitude that I had gotten the little girl home again without breaking her into splinters!

Additional comments on Camel handling characteristics by  Victor Yeates, author of "Winged Victory" (yes, it's a fictional novel, but his experiences of flying a camel were realistic, and are a valid, honest description)...


Re training:

"Camels were wonderful fliers when you had got used to them, which took about three months of hard flying. At the end of that time you were either dead, a nervous wreck, or the hell of a pilot and a terror to Huns . . ."

Re turns:

"And in the more legitimate matter of vertical turns, nothing in the skies could follow in so tight a circle..."

Re the half-roll (Split S):

"The same with the half-roll. Nothing would half-roll like a Camel. A twitch of the stick and flick of the rudder and you were on your back. The nose dropped at once and you pulled out having made a complete reversal of direction in the least possible time.

Thomson, the squadron stunt expert told him that it (half-roll) was just the first half of a roll followed by the second half of a loop; the only stunt useful in fighting. If you were going the wrong way, it was the quickest known method of returning in your slipstream."

Re the loop (he didn't like looping a Camel):

"But a Camel had to be flown carefully round with exactly the right amount of left rudder, or else it would rear and buck and hang upside down and flop and spin."

Re general flight:

" . . . a Camel had to be held in flying position all the time, and was out of it in a flash. It was nose light, having a rotary engine weighing next to nothing per horse power, and was rigged tail heavy so that you had to be holding her down all the time. Take your hand off the stick and it would rear right up with a terrific jerk and stand on its tail."

Re ground strafing (which he hated due to ground anti-ac machine gun fire):

"Unfortunately, they were good machines for ground-strafing. They could dive straight down on anything, and when a few feet off the ground, go straight up again."

Re speed:"...a Camel was a wonderful machine in a scrap. If only it had been fifty per cent faster! There was the rub. A Camel could neither catch anything except by surprise, nor hurry away from an awkward situation, and seldom had the option of accepting or declining combat...You couldn't have everything."

        The pathetically small fixed area on the fin/rudder made the problems in yaw even worse. A pilot generally doesn't hold the rudder pedals stiffly enough

                from the cockpit.  The camel has a CW propeller by every example
                I've been able to find. This source definitely says, "The 
                direction of rotation was counter-clockwise as seen from the 
                propeller-end of the engine." The photos also show a CCW (from 
                propeller-end) rotating prop.  That would be clockwise as seen 
                from the pilot's seat and sense=1. 
                http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Clerget
                 
                But sense=1 makes the Camel climb on RH 
                turn and dive on LH turn.  Lots of sources say the opposite,
                especially including this experienced pilot who is clearly 
                flying a craft with a CW propeller (as seen from cockpit) and 
                yet he says the Camel dives on RH turn and climbs on LH.
                
                 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6PnKUEFX8g
                
                Wikipedia says, "To easily ascertain the direction of gyro effect, simply remember that a rolling wheel tends, when it leans to the side, to turn in the direction of the lean." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties That means, for a CW (from the rear) propeller, a turn to the right causes nose to drop, exactly what is reported for the Camel.
                
                My conclusion is that JSBSim has it backwards and sense=1 corresponds to CCW rotation of the prop, as seen from the rear, as far as gyroscopic moment is concerned.

				However, as far as p_factor & torque is concerned, JSBSim seems to have it right.
                
                So what we're going to do is put in sense=-1 here to get correct gyroscopic effect, then we will use a function below in the aero section (roll)to correct (reverse) the torque effect, and we will insert a negative p_factor to correct that effect.
                
                (In an earlier version I tried using sense=1 and then aero functions to reverse/correct the gyroscopic effect, but that didn't seem to work well, perhaps because the gyroscopic effect is large and can change quite quickly, leading to lag problems.  At any rate, reversing the torque appears to work better, and requires only one function rather than two so it is simpler.)

We're modeling the 130 HP Clerget here, so 30 imp. gal in one tank and 7 in the other; plus 6.5 imperial gallons oil just behind engine.  Gasoline is 6.1 lbs per gallon and castor oil is    956 kg/m^3 or 7.97820666 pounds per u.s. gallon.  
 30 imp gal = 36.0285 gal = 219.8 lbs
  7 imp gal = 8.40665 gal = 51.3 lbs
  6.5 imp gal = 30 liters = 7.81 gal = 62.31 lbs 
          
  TODO: Not sure if fuel tanks need more code to draw from one to the other or switch between them.
  TODO: Oil is just a pointmass & doesn't empty throughout the flight (see Castor Oil below under pointmass).

               Create roll moment with a tendency
               to drop a wing at stall.
               This will help to induce a spin.

               From example/source of the following table (not Sopwith Camel):
               #The positive value at aero/alpha-deg = 10.35
               #is to simulate actual behavior.  The NACA
               #test report on stall behavior says that
               #initially it will drop the right wing and then
               #roll to the left as the stall deepens.
               #this commented out for Camel.
               
               The idea is that one wing stalls before the other.  When it stalls, it loses lift (equivalent of adding roll towards that wing) and adds drag (equivalent of yawing towards that wing)

               
               Camel: The idea of the p-aero-rad-_sec table is to turn the spin in the 
               direction of the current spin, ie, spin in the direction the
               AC is already spinning, if any.
               If we were tricky we could probably dot the yaw & spin together or something.

                    In short, pitch damp is high when the AOA is less than stall, but pitch damp greatly decreases when AOA becomes higher than stall.

                      - We know that some used FULL RUDDER on takeoff, easing it off after becoming airborne.
                      - We know that both R & L turns at max turn rate used FULL RUDDER.
                      
                      - The rudder was considered rather small and ineffective; consideration was given to increasing its size
                      
                     All these put a rather low bound how on effective the rudder was.

                Sopwith Camel replica

                extract from P1lot magazine November 1981

                Engine: Warner Super Scarab
                
                The rudder and elevator are very light and sensitive while the ailerons are astonishingly heavy, and appear to have practically no effect on anything at all. Heaving the stick from side to side produces a sort of drunken wallowing, like a politician trying to duck out of a commitment. A suspicious glance at the vibrating wings reveals that the ailerons are in fact still connected up -and the sight of them moving sluggishly in the airflow suggests the answer to the conundrum: the Camel has four enormous ailerons, and they are quite simply far too big. Furthermore, they have all the design subtlety of a quartet of barn doors. Frise effect, slotting, balancing, differential -these weren't even words in the aviation dictionary in 1916 when this lady was conceived, if you wanted your aeroplane to roll faster you just made the ailerons bigger. (And then, presumably, wondered why it didn't roll faster ... ) Those huge control surfaces so degrade the airflow over the wings that not only is their primary effect vastly blunted, but at the same time the drag thus engendered is awe-inspiring. Adverse yaw completely overcomes the normal secondary effect of roll, so that if you are so misguided as to take your feet off the Camel's rudder and then bank (say) to the left, the stubby round nose will instantly zap off to the right and keep going.    . . . 
                
                Thus I found that the Camel performed tight little loops, well-behaved spins, good stall-turns, and somewhat ponderous barrel rolls. Slow rolls, however, were something else again. She would just about do it if you insisted, but you had to start at nigh on Vne , use both hands to crank on full aileron -and then wait. And wait. And wait. She took 23 seconds to go round (compared to about six seconds in, say, a Chipmunk), and that 23 seconds felt like a fortnight. After the first 100 degrees or so the engine would pack up and you were left rolling in hideous slow motion with only the howl of the wind in the wires for company. Treading the rudder very gently -for only a touch too much out-roll rudder would be enough to overcome the ailerons and stop the roll altogether, leaving you stuck on your back like some helpless airborne turtle -you finally regained erect flight with perhaps 80 mph left ,whereupon you had to wait several more seconds before the Scarab would cough and splutter and belch and finally struggle back to its normal asthmatic blattering. (In the end I did slow rolls at three or four shows before sanity prevailed and I dropped the exercise as being too hard on both the airframe and the nervous system).
